    <h1>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h1>
    <p>Is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
        <br><br>
        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
        <br><br>
        An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <code>< title ></code>  tag can be written as <code>< Title ></code>, <code>< TITLE ></code>, or in any other way.
